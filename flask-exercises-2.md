# Flask Exercises 2

## Forms

Make a form to allow a user to enter a new project. When the form is submitted, insert a new row into the project table in your github database. To do this, you'll need 2 URLs:

* one to render the form page
* another to receive and handle the form submit

## Forms II

Choose a query in from the "my github" project that requires a parameter. Now create a separate form page that takes that parameter as input from the user, and substitutes in that parameter into the query. Like the previous problem, you'll need 2 URLs.

## Sessions

You will allow the user to sign in as a coder. They don't even need a password to sign in, just a name that matches a coder name in the database. Once they sign in, you will display their name and email address in the top navigation bar.

## My Projects

You will create a "My Projects" page, which displays the list of projects that the signed in user is a part of. It will display the projects ranked by the most stars.
